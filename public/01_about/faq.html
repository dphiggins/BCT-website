                    Any elementary, middle, or high school student living in the United States is
                    eligible for our services regardless of their economic and immigration status,
                    race, sex, etc. We ourselves are based around the Greater Boston area and serve
                    primarily students in the Northeast region of the United States.

                <p>
                    Our organization currently includes over 200 tutors, each with their own
                    expertise. This vast tutor pool allows us to cater to various subject needs
                    of our students. We are able to offer subjects in all core categories:
                    mathematics, science, English/literature, history/social studies, modern and
                    classical languages, and some ISEE and SSAT test prep (may be limited). Please
                    check out our
                        <a href="./../02_subjects/index.html">subjects page</a>
                    to learn more about our offerings.

            <button class="accordion">Where are your tutors from? And how do they get screened?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our tutors are mostly located within the Greater Boston area and the Northeast
                    region of the United States and have all been screened through a rigorous
                    application and interview process. Many of our tutors attend top private and
                    public schools and colleges in their region, including BB&N, Milton Academy,
                    Roxbury Latin School, Belmont High School, Boston University, University of
                    Chicago, Harvard University, and more. We evaluate strengths, weaknesses,
                    prior experience, and many other variables in order to admit qualified tutors.
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">What application is used for the tutoring session?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our tutors use the video and web conferencing application Zoom to connect with
                    students. If a student does not have access to Zoom, then our tutors are able
                    to offer sessions via FaceTime, Google Meet, etc.
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Do your tutors provide lessons or just help with school/student work?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>
                    We are able to do both. Our organization places a heavy focus on catering to
                    the specific needs of each student; thus, each student is paired with a tutor
                    that can best fulfill their needs and meet their requirements.

                    In order to sign up to receive tutoring, simply look towards the top menu bar,
                    click on Sign Up, and fill out the registration form.

            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Tutoring is completely free, as our organization believes in spreading
                    education to all students in need regardless of their economic status.

                <br>
                <p>
                    We strongly recommend students, families, and volunteers to sign up at the
                    location nearest to where they live. However, feel free to sign up for any of
                    the locations as all of our operations and services are conducted online and
                    primarily over Zoom. As a result, we are able to serve students all across the
                    United States, regardless of where they live.

                <p>
                    After filling out the registration form, prospective students only need to
                    wait for several days before being matched with a tutor. This tutor will then
                    contact the student and/or their family through email to set up an initial
                    meeting, where further logistical details will be discussed.

                <p>
                    After filling out the volunteer application, prospective tutors only need to
                    wait for several days before being contacted by a member of our organization’s
                    leadership team. We will then set up an interview time with the prospective
                    tutor, during which we will evaluate the prospective tutor and their fit with
                    our organization.
