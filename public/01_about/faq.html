            <button class="accordion">Who is eligible for your service?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>Any elementary, middle, or high school student living in Massachusetts is eligible for our services
                    regardless of their economic and immigration status
                    , race, sex, etc. We ourselves are based around the Massachusetts area.</p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What subjects do you offer?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>Our organization currently includes dozens of tutors, each with their own expertise. This vast tutor pool
                    allows us to cater to various subject needs of our students.
                    We are able to offer subjects in all core categories: mathematics, science, English/literature,
                    history/social studies, modern and classical languages, and some ISEE
                    and SSAT test prep (may be limited). Please check out our subjects page to learn more about our
                    offerings.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Where are your tutors from? And how do they get screened?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>Our tutors are mostly located within the Massachusetts area and have all been screened through a
                    rigorous application and interview process. We evaluate strengths, weaknesses,
                    prior experience, and many other variables in order to admit qualified tutors.</p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What application is used for the tutoring session?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>Our tutors use the video and web conferencing application Zoom to connect with students. If a student
                    does not have access to Zoom, then our tutors are able to offer sessions via FaceTime, Google Meet, etc.
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Do your tutors provide lessons or just help with school/student work?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>We are able to do both. Our organization places a heavy focus on catering to the specific needs of each
                    student; thus, each student is paired with a tutor that can best fulfill their needs and meet their
                    requirements.</p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">How do you sign up to receive tutoring?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>In order to sign up to receive tutoring, simply look towards the top menu bar, click on Sign Up, and fill
                    out the registration form.</p>
                <br>

            <button class="accordion">How do you sign up to volunteer?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>In order to sign up to volunteer, simply look towards the top menu bar, click on Volunteer, and fill out
                    the volunteer application.</p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Is this service free?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>Tutoring is completely free, as our organization believes in spreading education to all students in need
                    regardless of their economic status.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p>After filling out the registration form, prospective students only need to wait for several days before
                    being matched with a tutor. This tutor will then contact
                    the student and/or their family through email to set up an initial meeting, where further logistical
                    details will be discussed.</p>

                <br>
                <p>After filling out the volunteer application, prospective tutors only need to wait for several days before
                    being contacted by a member of our organization’s
                    leadership team. We will then set up an interview time with the prospective tutor, during which we will
                    evaluate the prospective tutor and their fit with our organization.</p>
