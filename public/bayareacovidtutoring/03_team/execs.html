She is co-founder of Bay Area Covid Tutoring and helps manage daily operations for the organization. Living in Silicon Valley, Emma understood the importance of technology, especially during the pandemic. After working with RRRcomputer, an organization that refurbishes used computers and donates them to public schools, Emma wanted to find a way to provide some aid to students online when going to school in person is difficult. Outside of school, Emma enjoys Model UN conferences, playing tennis and skiing, and being the layout editor to Milton’s primary newsletter. Emma hopes that BACT will make an amazing impact on all tutors and tutees just as volunteering in Boston has done for her.</p>

David founded BCT during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic after realizing that education is a critical aspect of one’s life that can promote social mobility and develop critical thinking skills. With the pandemic having exacerbated the economic and educational inequalities in his country, David wanted to give back to his community. Inspired by his own experiences with tutoring, David hopes that students will not only receive the educational experience they may need but also the opportunity to cultivate a lasting relationship with their tutor. In his spare time, he enjoys playing the oboe, writing for his school newspaper, and spending time with his family. David hopes to truly make a positive impact in his community by providing this service to any children in need—regardless of their background.</p>
